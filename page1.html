    <h1>Portable computing devices</h1>
    <hr>
    <img width="50%" style="margin-left: 25%;" src="1200px-PalmTX.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Several categories of portable computing devices can run on batteries but are not usually classified as laptops: portable computers, PDAs, ultra mobile PCs (UMPCs), tablets, and smartphones.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>A portable computer (discontinued) is a general-purpose computer that can be easily moved from place to place, but cannot be used while in transit, usually because it requires some "setting-up" and an AC power source. The most famous example is Osborne 1. Portable computers are also called a "transportable" or a "luggable" PC.</p></li>
        <li><p>A personal digital assistant (PDA) (discontinued) is a small, usually pocket-sized, computer with limited functionality. It is intended to supplement and to synchronize with a desktop computer, giving access to contacts, address book, notes, e-mail, and other features.</p></li>
        <li><p>An ultra mobile PC (discontinued) is a full-featured, PDA-sized computer running a general-purpose operating system.</p></li>
        <li><p>Tablets/phones: a slate tablet is shaped like a paper notebook. Smartphones are the same devices as tablets, however, the only difference with smartphones is that they are much smaller and pocketable. Instead of a physical keyboard, these devices have a touchscreen including a combination of a virtual keyboard but can also link to a physical keyboard via wireless Bluetooth or USB. These devices include features other computer systems would not be able to incorporate, such as built-in cameras, because of their portability - although some laptops possess camera integration, and desktops and laptops can connect to a webcam by way of USB.</p></li>
        <li><p>A carputer is installed in an automobile. It operates as a wireless computer, sound system, GPS, and DVD player. It also contains word processing software and is Bluetooth compatible.</p></li>
        <li><p>A Pentop (discontinued) is a computing device the size and shape of a pen. It functions as a writing utensil, MP3 player, language translator, digital storage device, and calculator.</p></li>
        <li><p>An application-specific computer is one that is tailored to a particular application. For example, Ferranti introduced a handheld application-specific mobile computer (the MRT-100) in the form of a clipboard for conducting opinion polls.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Boundaries that separate these categories are blurry at times. For example, the OQO UMPC is also a PDA-sized tablet PC; the Apple eMate had the clamshell form factor of a laptop but ran PDA software. The HP Omnibook line of laptops included some devices small more enough to be called ultra mobile PCs. The hardware of the Nokia 770 internet tablet is essentially the same as that of a PDA such as the Zaurus 6000; the only reason it's not called a PDA is that it does not have PIM software. On the other hand, both the 770 and the Zaurus can run some desktop Linux software, usually with modifications.</p>

    <h1>Portable Computing Devices In Our Everyday Lives</h1>
    <p>What is a Portable Computing Device? A Portable Computing Device (also known as a Mobile Computing Device)is defined by Techopedia.com as "any device that is created using mobile components, such as mobile hardware and software. Mobile computing devices are portable devices capable of operating, executing and providing services and applications like a typical computing device."</p>
    <p>The following table shows the most popular types of Portable Computing Devices.</p>
    <table border=2>
        <tr><td><h2>Types of Portable Computing Devices</td><td><h2>Description</td><td><h2>Image</td></tr></h2>
        <tr><td><h3>Laptop Computer</td><td> "A portable computer, usually battery-powered, small enough to rest on the user's 
        lap and having a screen that closes over the keyboard like a lid."<br> Some examples of Laptop Computers are; the Apple MacBook (Pro, Air,or original), 
        the Acer Swift,and the ASUS VivoBook</td><td> <img src="laptop pic.jpg" height=170></td></tr> </a>
        <tr><td><h3>Tablet</td><td> "A tablet is a wireless, portable personal computer with a touchscreen interface. The tablet form factor is 
        typically smaller than a notebook computer, but larger than a smartphone."<br> Some examples of tablet computers are; the Apple iPad (as shown on the right), 
        the Microsoft Surface, and the Samsung Galaxy Tab.  </td><td><img src="ipad picture.jpg" height=170></td></tr>
        <tr><td><h3>Smartphone</td><td>"A mobile phone that performs many of the functions of a computer, typically having a touchscreen interface, 
        Internet access, and an operating system capable of running downloaded apps."<br> Some examples of Smartphones are; The Apple iPhone X, the Samsung Galaxy Note 8,
         and the Google Pixel 2.</td><td><img src="iphone pic.jpg" height=170></td></tr>

    <h2> How each device is used day to day and it's history </h2>
<h3>Laptop Computer</h3>
"The computer considered by most historians to be the first true portable computer was the Osborne 1. Adam Osborne, an ex-book publisher was the founder of Osborne Computer Corp, which produced the Osborne 1 in 1981. It was a portable computer that weighed 24 pounds and cost $1795." 
 Laptop Computers are extremely popular with everyone from young students to their retired grandparents, they are very portable due to their ability to fold like a clamshell,
they are also designed quite basically, making them overall easy to use and take care of for people of all ages.<p>
<h3>Tablets</h3>
While iPad's may be the best known for starting the Tablet Computer trend, Microsoft actually created the first "Tablet Computer" in 2002. Tablet Computers have only come to the general population in recent years, but they have been extremely popular since the first generation iPads general release in April 2010.
With the release of the iPad came a massive consensus for more tablet computers, they are easy to use, they have a touch screen feature that for many people is much easier to use than a normal computer keyboard and mouse,
with their sleek/ simple design they are very portable and easy to use on the go.
<h3>Smartphones</h3>
The term "Smartphone" wasn't used until three years later in 1995, but the first actual "Smartphone" was created by IBM in 1992 and was called the "Simon Personal Communicator", Apple's iPhone wasn't created for another 15 years.
Smartphones are used by almost everyone these days, if somebody were to pull out an older generation "Flip Phone" questions would be asked. Smartphones can range quite a bit in size, some of the larger models even being called "Phablets" (Phone/ Tablet). Because of how they are made it is practically like carrying a computer around in your pocket with some basic phone features, and an easy to use touch screen display.
